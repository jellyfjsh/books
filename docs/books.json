    "review": "This is fun and somewhat interesting, but it has nothing on The Hole. I like the strangeness of this, though, and Oyamada is a wizard at writing weird kind of unimaginable and phantasmic animals. It didn’t really feel contrived or cliché for a book whose most obvious themes and settings could easily feel that way, which I appreciate. The characters are interesting, and good quietly curious views into the factory. All of this however is even more true of The Hole, which is simply fantastic. Obviously this is, like, about the environment and industrial capitalism and plants and animals, but I would love to read something by Oyamada that is <b>about</b> about the environment. I think it would be so wriggly and wondrous.",

I would like to read more from Mabanckou now, and am happy to have read this after a long time of wanting to and actually starting and not finishing it a while ago. The beginning is just fantastic. The parts with Bonaventure/Kokolo are just the best, and I think the beloved childhood friendship adds to how funny it is sometimes. \"This particular warden, who we secretly referrrred to as the 'Australopithecus', looked like an ancient chameleon, with his crooked back and eyes that pointed out left and right, without him moving his head.\" That's awesome.",

I would describe it as...quiet? Kitamura writes tension and suspense really well, especially when it comes to characters who know things about each other that they don't admit they know about each other, but that the other character knows they know. You know? This is my fourth book in four days, and I now understand how people that read novels read so many of them. I am enjoying learning what I like in fiction, and about writing. This book is quite straightforwardly done I think.",

    "review": "It feels strange to say anything about it, because it's sort of so obvious and evil that you can't, really. But in terms of the book itself, I thought the transition between parts was brilliantly done, and obviously the mirroring is fantastic. The officer's kind of silence and repetition and psychopathy is well done. Craft-wise it is very precise, and everyone should read it. Something else I appreciated was the way the researcher character of course comes up against checkpoints and potentially Israeli individuals who would stand in her way, but ultimately she is able to get through most of them: they tell her things, let her see documents, the fear about being stopped or arrested at borders are real but she is not stopped (although it takes a great deal of brutal effort to make it all happen, of course). I found it really helpful to read this character who can actually navigate space and interaction with some effectiveness even under her conditions (again, with all that brutal effort); I think it is a meaningful illustration of the way this violence often operates for people, and the way it turns into murder on a dime and without contradiction. Free Palestine, of course, now and always in every direction, and the grief is endless.",

The sister thing is really sad. I can’t help but love these literary depressives (in terms of theme, or maybe more accurately vibe). Sometimes you do wake up a bug(/vermin/insect, take your translation pick) and not recover. Unrelated: how big is he in bug form? I’m imagining about a foot or a foot and a half circumference, which is unrealistically large and scary but not so ginormous that he wouldn’t be able to kind of sneak in behind people as he does. I think that classic illustration of the bug on his back on the bed depicts him too large basically.",

There is a weird blurb on the back of this from The New Yorker that says \"Ōe's themes of abnormality, sexuality, and marginality are outside the tradition of Japanese equipoise\" and that he is \"more akin to Mailer, Grass, or Roth than to many Japanese novelists.\" I of course don't really know much about this, but that doesn't really seem to be true. I feel like of the Japanese (male-authored) novels I've read from the 20th century, this is *extremely* within that universe. But anyway. I don't really get the weird sexuality of this – I get that the whole thing is about a baby, but it was weird. I'm sorry it was just weird. But for the most part I think I liked reading it and it was interesting enough. I would almost describe it as muted(?) given the horror of the subject. So that was interesting. I think I'm finally starting to get novels. I should read something less extremely dark. Oh I forgot to mention but I think the nuclear stuff is really interesting.",

It was however interesting that a lot of this felt repetitive from African urban histories in the postwar period, in some ways. I also appreciate the general arguments about how hillbilly/Appalachian culture has been misrepresented historically and today, based often on racial categorizations and the essentialization of people from those areas. So, I guess useful. And I don't usually read American histories, so interesting in that respect. But just not interesting in a lot of other ways.",

So maybe I'll learn some \"macro\" grand narrative big man stuff too, but I love stuff like this. I think (as a pretty uneducated outsider) that it is extremely fortunate Han decided to write this given his intimacy with the village and villagers.

I guess that's the point in a lot of ways, and I think that might be fair, but it also leaves everyone in a weird position when it comes to criticizing it. But I don't have the resources or energy to really do that criticism, so I'll leave it at \"unsettling\" and \"disturbing.\" I did enjoy the last few chapters on suicide especially, and I think that's where some of the strongest theorizing came out. Quite a bit more of environmentalism/ecology/etc. would have added a lot to this, I think, even if I do understand that that might be outside of its scope. At the same time, though, I don't know how it can possibly be outside of the scope, so I think Berardi's general neglect (aside from a few moments) of the area is a major limitation (even failure). Anyway, interesting, for sure.",

So, I did enjoy this, but I think the form makes it difficult to really get super into. Which I guess is kind of the point of a (very) short story collection like this, but I'm not sure I'm into it.

The books are remarkably similar, though, and take up some similar case studies (though Sliwinski's adds more historical detail and elaborates on different cases). Sontag is a great writer and a great thinker, and I did appreciate this.",

    "review": "This is superb, really. It's unsettling, and I think Segahl's use of the word \"evasive\" (quoted in the blurb) is really a perfect one. Nothing is really explained, but I think there is so much here that I can imagine so much being said regardless -- and, of course, it is probably the lack of explanation that makes this so enjoyable. It's an extremely fun read, and what strikes me most is just how <i>lush</i> it is. The human-nature borders are so blurred that this just reads like a forest of a book, and it's really, genuinely, amazing. One of my favorite descriptions comes towards the end: \"In the bushes beyond the sun, a black shadow blinked. A pair of bright yellow circles closed, then opened again. A large, round frog\" (52). It's just magical!<br/><br/>Anyway, I think this is splendid. I should probably give it 5 stars, and maybe I'll come back at some point and do that. I'd be really interested to learn more about the commentaries on work, womanhood, as well as the symbolism of water (which really doesn't seem to be water), nature, this strange, black animal, children, old people and aging, the holes, and more. This is an extremely rich book, but somehow also extremely contained. The craft is amazing.",

I was continuously amazed by the complexity of this work, but also by its deep humanity and self-criticism. It is profoundly aware of itself, and I think that's an ethic absolutely essential to any work of history, especially an oral history dealing with such a terrible era (and, of course, its long term outcomes).

Clearly there's a lot going on throughout the whole book, but I think the emotional resonance of the first two chapters really stuck out. Perhaps my favorite part of the whole thing: \"Should I have gone there, right then? If I had, would I have been able to find you, Dong-Ho, to ease the terror you must have felt at having just been knocked from your body? With that thick, heavy blood still creeping from my shadow-eyes, amid the dawn light being calved from the night slow as an iceberg, I found it impossible to move\" (66). It's devastating, and I think the book is the strongest emotionally when it's centered on Dong-Ho and Jeong-dae -- perhaps this is why the last chapter stuck out to me as well. <br/><br/>Basically, there's a lot to be said here, and I think Han is really concerned with the lives of ordinary people in the midst of political terror (her use of perspective is super interesting in that context), which makes this a book I did enjoy thematically. The execution was a little weird at times, which is why I didn't give it a higher rating, but I did enjoy it overall. Not the best, not the worst, certainly wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if it wasn't so centrally concerned with something I wasn't already so interested in.",

There was, at times, a tendency to lean into overly complex verbiage to explain something which I thought could have been more effectively described more simply, but once I got past those parts the rest of it was pretty enjoyable as a read. I think Meiches levels a pretty solid critique of what he calls the hegemonic understanding of genocide, and he is very much grounded in the real world, which is nice. I have found myself referring to this book (mentally and out loud) in classes and elsewhere, which is a sign that it offered something to me that I will take forward. Overall, not my favorite book I've ever read, but certainly one I'm glad I did read. The conclusion was particularly well done in the way of exploring the implications of the hegemonic understanding for the present and especially the future.",

    "review": "Okay. So. I hated this. And not in a \"It was infuriating\" way, just in a \"Wow! This sucks\" way. And that's harsh, I know. Maybe it isn't even fair at all - after all, I know very little about art or its critics, and this book clearly belongs to a discourse I'm wildly unfamiliar with. But that means very little to me, especially because it literally just isn't my job to be totally familiar with the discourse. No doubt I will reconsider, and perhaps some of Nelson's critiques might become more relevant as I learn more, but I don't think this fundamental impression will shift all that much. <br/><br/>Many of the reviews I've read of this book have followed this general pattern: \"This book doesn't make many conclusions, but this is a good thing, because it opens up a discussion, introduces the reader to new art, and asks questions without attempting to solve them.\" I find that utterly ridiculous. If I wanted to be introduced to new art without someone else making conclusions for me about it, I'd just go to Wikipedia and scroll for hours. I am also not all that convinced by the common reviewer sentiment that \"Even if the book doesn't say a lot, Nelson's exquisite writing kept me going\". I didn't find her writing all that great (it kind of just felt like a combination of, say, Solnit with some academic. Which isn't a bad thing, but definitely not groundbreaking), and the only thing that kept me going to the end was the art itself. But that has very little to do with this book, and again, the same thing could be accomplished by a nice journey into Wikipedia. <br/><br/>Basically, this book says nothing. When it gets close to saying something, it pulls back, almost like it's afraid to make a conclusion (even a tentative one. Maybe not even a conclusion at all, but something on the way there!). And I understand that this may be part of the point; art might even be defined by the way it evades conclusion. But if you are going to write a book about cruelty in art, you might want to be prepared to make a claim about cruelty in art. Now, if you want to publish a series of diary entries or blog posts about your personal reactions to art, fine. But don't act like it's \"A Reckoning\". <br/><br/>Perhaps a significant reason for my vitriol comes from the weird apolitical and ahistorical nature of much of the book. That's not to say you have to adopt a historicist view of art at all, but to ignore the political, historical, and social dimensions of art is almost offensive. Nelson herself seems to be conscious of this, actually, and she does address it somewhat in the concluding chapters. But here, there's something even weirder than ignoring the historico-political. For at the end, when she finally decides to address politics, it is because she finally addresses black women - as if the only thing that is inherently political is blackness, womanhood, <i>black womanhood</i>. Why is it only the black woman dealing with slavery and personal trauma whose work draws the strongest, most lucid critique of narcissism in art? When Bacon, Warhol, and Artaud create, they are producing something autonomous, something worthy unto itself of critique (or, in Nelson's case, of admiration). But when Walker creates, her work is inextricably tied to her, or, to her black womanhood. It's perfectly legitimate to consider the creator in an analysis of the creation. But such a framework should then be applied universally. Otherwise we end up where we already are, where white men speak to all and everyone else must keep to themselves, for their work is too charged, too political, too <i>specific</i> to be universal.<br/><br/>In her discussion of Sierra, she says that \"the artist has the power neither to restore nor to annihilate\" the dignity of their subject (128). I find this ridiculous. Maybe the artist doesn't have that power (though I think they probably do), but the artist is a human being. Human beings do have that power, and to suggest that art exists outside of the human sphere even in a discussion of cruelty is almost appalling to me. But maybe the book can get by with that because it does not make conclusions. I would almost call that cowardly, especially when we are dealing with cruelty. All of this to say, art is not just between the creation and the viewer. It emerges out of a specific context, and it emerges into specific contexts, over and over again each time it is considered. To separate it from those contexts, to mention in passing Abu Ghraib as though it is aesthetically and politically analogous to women creating grotesque performance art is to me immensely cruel, and not in the way Nelson implies. <br/><br/>Where she does make points, and where this book is the strongest, is in regard to the violence against women's bodies. But I think these points are made better and more fiercely elsewhere (Machado's [b:Her Body and Other Parties|33375622|Her Body and Other Parties|Carmen Maria Machado|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485266434l/33375622._SX50_.jpg|54116423] comes to mind), so they don't really redeem anything in my view. There is also a surprising lack of reference to queer and postcolonial criticisms (and, of course, black and BIPOC criticisms, though I don't know as much about those and do not feel prepared to comment on them in more detail). [a:Edward Said|21570252|Edward Said|https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png], for example, has some interesting things to say when it comes to cultural production and cruelty, but perhaps Nelson's apolitical lens and (legitimate, though limiting) focus on bodily horror prevents her from engaging him. <br/><br/>TL;DR: At best this was boring, and at worst it was appalling.",

    "review": "I really truly enjoyed this. The reasons for this are of course several, but I think it boils down to the following: Anderson's uncompromising commitment to comparative and transnational histories and his humor and ease of writing. Of course, the ideas themselves are wonderful and important, and I find very interesting the analysis of print-capitalism as a parent of the idea of the nation. But if that idea is assumed as having a European character, Anderson fully disagrees, and that's where the comparative aspect comes in. From South America to Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe to Western Europe to North America, this book is not concerned at all with just one locale, and it is in fact rather polemical in its insistence on global comparison. (Notable, of course, is the lack of significant consideration of South Asia, the Middle East, and most of Africa, but Anderson does his part to recognize that lack and explain the gaps in his own expertise). It is so unbelievably refreshing to read a book undefined by its geographical scope and determined to make global ideas and arguments which we tend to restrict only to a nation or a region. Given that this book is tied up so tightly with the ideas of globalization, this is perhaps natural, but as is shown by much of the scholarly work in the \"Western canon\", it is not at all the norm.<br/><br/>Then there is the style and humor of Anderson and his writing. What immediately comes to mind is a footnote included in a description of changes in education and print in SE Asia: \"No less alarming were smuggled Chinese translation so such troubling French authors as Rousseau\" (125). Nothing to say about that other than that it's just really good. I think the epilogue in which Anderson recounts the many translations of his book is very much emblematic of this: he comes across as a human being writing about human beings, not as some ivory tower academic who studies human culture but seems to have not spoken a word to a human being since they hid away to finish their PhD.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that it's a bit long and at times repetitive, and I feel that certain points could have been made more clearly and distinct had they not been squeezed by other considerations. But that's a small price to pay, and clearly the advantages of this book outweigh its issues. <br/><br/>Of course, most interesting to me is the consideration of colonialism and anti-colonialism, and I think Anderson does well to explain his own lack in knowledge of certain places and ideas. He makes it rather clear that he in fact <i>wants</i> other scholars of the Global South to expand upon what he has done here. But in the areas he is sure of, he is rather brilliant. One of my favorite passages is as follows: \"In this colony, as in each separate, other colony, it [the patronizing and colonial Dutch word <i>inlanders</i> for people indigenous to their SE Asian colonies] meant that the persons referred to were both 'inferior' <i>and 'belonged there'</i> [...] Conversely, the Dutch by such langauge assigned themselves, along with superiority, 'not-belonging-there'. [...] Yet even this miserable equality of condition [i.e. the inferiority implied by <i>inlander</i>] had a definite perimeter. For <i>inlander</i> always raised the question 'native of what?'\" (122).",

    "review": "So, I didn't love this, but I didn't not like it either. <br/><br/><b>\"The Husband Stitch\"</b> seems to be a favorite of a lot of people, but honestly, it was one of my least favorites. Part of that speaks to how I felt about the book in general - it is so wrapped up in motherhood (especially motherhood of very young children) that there wasn't really much I, as an 18 year old, could really latch on to. Other than that, though, this story just felt kind of blah. The ending so many people love wasn't shocking to me at all. <br/><br/><b>\"Inventory\"</b> was kind of similar in some ways. More interesting because it seemed less formulaic and predictable, but I was kind of bored by it. <br/><br/><b>\"Mothers\"</b> was the first story in this that I'd say I actually kind of enjoyed. I say \"kind of\" because a large part of my issue with this book is just that I don't love the writing style for some reason. Maybe because I'm not that familiar with contemporary literature, but it didn't do a lot for me. And even though I am, of course, not myself a mother, this story still felt like it held some weight. The unreliable narrator is an interesting one.<br/><br/><b>\"Especially Heinous\"</b> was sometimes very interesting, but it was also very, very long, which for me kind of diluted the ideas and made the whole thing feel rather repetitive. But, at the same time, I understand that there could be a point to that - i.e. communicating the repetitive nature of our obsession with media focused on violence against women. It is, after all, true that shows like SVU are saturated with endless sexual violence. There were some parts of this that I just thought were brilliantly written, like \"'Uncivilized': They find the boy in Central Park, looking like no one had ever loved him. 'His body was crawling with ants,' Stabler says. 'Ants.' Two days later, they arrest his teacher, who as it turns out had loved him just fine\" (66). Later: \"'Blood': The butcher takes a hose to the floor, and the blood spirals and sinks down the drain. It wasn't animal blood, but he has no way of knowing what it was that his assistant was cutting up. The evidence is destroyed. The girls remain lost forever,\" followed immediately by \"'Parts': 'Is it me, or is this steak kind of gamey?' Benson's date says to Benson\" (97). Machado is clearly a very gifted (and very intelligent) writer. <br/><br/><b>\"Real Women Have Bodies\"</b> was interesting, I guess, but didn't do a lot for me. It didn't feel that thematically profound, but maybe I just need to read it again to get more out of it. That holds true for all of these stories; they are the kind of thing I think you'd really get something new out of with every read.<br/><br/><b>\"Eight Bites\"</b> was by far the most familiar to me personally, and also the least surreal or fantastical, which overall made it one of the most enjoyable pieces in here. I just think I don't really enjoy fantasy or surrealism that much (though perhaps I could with time). The rage of the narrator's daughter was one of my favorite parts.<br/><br/><b>\"The Resident\"</b> was pretty good, and I found it somewhat relatable (kind of in the way that certain passages of [b:Notes of a Crocodile|31395589|Notes of a Crocodile|Qiu Miaojin|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485290594l/31395589._SY75_.jpg|52089137] was, actually) in some parts. But other than that, I did enjoy the balance of surreal elements with realism, and the way that the cast of characters were at once highly vulnerable (them being there to create) and kind of mysterious. <br/><br/>So, overall, this was decent. Didn't love it. Found parts of it kind of obvious and other parts pretty foreign to my own experience (which, of course, isn't a fault of the book, but just relevant to my reading of it). Probably won't read it again, but might think more about it and its themes.",

    "review": "Honestly? I think this was great. It is well-written and clear, and its central claims emerge naturally from the text. Usually I'm not super into such straightforward narrative histories (e.g. [b:The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan|721931|The Great Partition  The Making of India and Pakistan|Yasmin Khan|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328827936l/721931._SX50_.jpg|708170]), but I actually think this worked really well. I hesitate to say I enjoyed it (the subject is not one which can be enjoyed), but I'd something like that is true of the reading process itself. Also, this is clearly written for an American (or perhaps Western European) audience. And that's not really a problem (Chang makes it clear from the outset that it is in fact her goal), but I did find myself wishing for more, particularly from the Chinese perspective. This isn't really a valid criticism, though, given that so much information is, for various reasons, more readily available from Euro-American sources. What I'm really saying, I guess, is in perfect alignment with much of Chang's point: that the silence of victims (coerced or otherwise) is profoundly tragic, and leads to tremendous gaps in understanding about the Rape, its causes, and its outcomes. 20 years out of the book's publication, with nearly all victims and perpetrators dead, this point is only more devastating. <br/>On that note, the historical significance of this book is also worthy of mention, and I can see why its publication generated so much controversy (for lack of a better word) upon its release. One can only hope that truth is not squashed any further, but even this provides little recompense, for witnesses are now few and far between; many of those still alive were probably themselves born of genocidal rape in 1938. <br/>Academically, I am of course fascinated (if that word can be used) by atrocity, and this book makes me want to learn more about Japan in China, South Korea, SE Asia, and elsewhere. I would be interested to engage with a comparative history of empire and atrocity, particularly between Japan and the Western European imperialists. It also sparks my interest further in reading about women in war and genocide (both as perpetrators and as victims), particularly the role played by sex (consensual or not) and rape. I think Chang did well to express the significance of sexual violence alongside murder and mutilation to the tyranny of Imperial Japan. <br/>But, ultimately, there is nothing which can be said that means anything without the knowledge of the horror and the tragedy of the Rape. And perhaps even that cannot be fully known or spoken about, simply because it is too terrible, too horrific, to even fully comprehend.",

The arguments and their conclusions are wide and in some cases wonderful, which makes this overall a rewarding read.

But ultimately, in the battle between Sartre and Camus, I think the latter emerges victorious - both philosophically and politically. <br/>Basically, I really like Camus, and I think he's right about a lot of things, but at the end of the day this is still the European philosophical canon, and it is therefore full of wonderful ideas floating within a sea of other (super irritating) stuff. The three stars are in reference to the work itself, not to the core ideas, which I of course adore and find highly cogent and meaningful in many other contexts - including the anticolonial.",

    "review": "First of all, I really like this NYRB edition. <br/>But other than that, I think really loved this (I think). I also think I didn't understand it at all, yet I also understood it entirely. What strikes me most is the brilliance of it all, of all of its characters - Lazi's inability to let herself live without thinking, every character's simultaneous wicked intellect and immense capacity for emotion. That is something wholly unfamiliar to me (at least one side of it), and so I can't really empathize with it, but I like that. What is familiar to me is being completely unable to stop relating my own experiences to the world of theory and ideas - \"I devoured all kinds of books for tortured souls. Started collecting issues of the independence movement's weekly. Studied up on political game theory, an antidote to my spiritual reading. It made me feel like an outsider, which became my way of recharging. At the break of dawn, around six or seven, like a nocturnal creature afraid of the light, I'd finally lay my head - which by then was spilling over with thoughts - down onto the comforter. That's how it went when things were good\" (11). <br/>This is a book about heartbreak, coming-of-age, and relationships. But it's also (perhaps more fundamentally) a book about queerness, about growing up and loving and hating within a mind and body which are inherently subversive without ever having chosen to be so. That, it seems, comes with a level of rage, one which of course becomes immensely tragic with the end of Qiu's life in mind, but which on its own is both familiar and difficult to really describe. Every character in this is just so angry and broken in some way, in what seems to be a distinctly queer fashion. And I think there is a kind of rage inherent to so much of queerness, wherein one emerges into the world a pariah for their capacity to love. <br/>I'm also fascinated by the crocodile. Why a crocodile? It seems clear that it is a metaphor for queerness - particularly for the way that queerness is constructed by the non-queer world as a political-biological problem based in simultaneous horror and fascination (perhaps temptation) - but I'll have to do some reading to figure out why it's the crocodile, specifically. Also, at some points, the crocodile passages seemed to be metaphoric for some kind of racial or ethnic apartheid, too, which of course makes me think of colonial Africa but which might in this context be more appropriately connected to Taiwan (or perhaps China) specifically. Interesting.<br/>Stylistically, I liked it. A lot of people's reviews of this book are harsh on its meandering style or its angsty, youthful nihilism. In regards to the first critique (that of style), I guess that's fair, but then that's kind of just a total write-off of massive swaths of modernist and postmodernist literature. Stick to genre fiction and the classics, I guess. The second critique is also subjectively fair, but I think a lot of that comes down to people being older when they read this. I'm basically in the same part of my life that Lazi was when this book started, so much of it feels very familiar to me. The brand of youthful existential angst constant in her life is also rather endemic to my own, even if it's a lot less emotional in my case than in hers. It's probably the perfect time for me to have read this. <br/>This is long, but whatever. I liked this a lot. I think I'm starting to understand literature. It's still much harder for me to read than my trusty academic nonfiction, but I'm starting to get it.",

    "review": "I think this book largely accomplished what it set out to accomplish, i.e. outlining Partition narratively and establishing chaos and uncertainty as its essential characteristics. So my rating isn't so much about that, but moreso about my personal reaction to it.<br/>First of all, I kind of hated how this was written, and my stylistic objection got worse as it went on. I just wish Khan had used more commas. Second, I think that because I already knew a fair bit about Partition, this felt pretty simplistic. Especially because I had just read [b:When Victims Become Killers: Colonialism, Nativism, and the Genocide in Rwanda|66419|When Victims Become Killers  Colonialism, Nativism, and the Genocide in Rwanda|Mahmood Mamdani|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388515349l/66419._SY75_.jpg|1340078], I felt like this left me with a lot of questions parallel to those Mamdani asked in his book - How did the political identities of 'Hindu' and 'Muslim' change, and why? What were the regional patterns which contributed to Partition even being possible, and where prior to World War II did its origins lie? I get that this wasn't really the goal of this book, so I can't really fault it for not including such questions, but for me personally the whole thing felt kind of basic. But if you're looking for a good introduction to Partition in its own time, this is pretty solid.",

    "review": "I'm kind of genuinely stunned by this book in every way. What sticks out to me the most, though, is how immensely wonderful Chu seems to me personally. She emerges from this book appearing like the exact person I would love to be friends with; someone whose inner life is also her outer life, whose criticism of the world extends to (and perhaps begins with) herself. Speaking personally here, I hope I reflect some of that myself, and I think I do in some ways. It's irreverent and disdainful, yet at the same time joyful and immensely empathetic. <br/>This is not the kind of book I would ordinarily rank so highly, but I find it to be so refreshing that I don't really think I have any other choice. The merging of the memoir with theory - internal with external - is so graceful and immense that I honestly think it's a hint into what a lot of works in a similar vein might look like in the coming decades.<br/>All of that aside, though, the truth is just that this is insanely fun and refreshing to read. I know a lot of it is crazy, and maybe even stupid, but that's kind of the point. My high rating comes not really from the theoretical strength of the text (which I would say is rather interesting, though not particularly revolutionary or even good), but from the style of it all. I think that if we take this seriously as a memoir, there's a lot more room for an extremely positive impression. If we assume it is trying to be [b:Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|85767|Gender Trouble  Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|Judith Butler|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349037224l/85767._SY75_.jpg|2249813] or even [b:Bad Feminist|18813642|Bad Feminist|Roxane Gay|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421292744l/18813642._SY75_.jpg|26563816], I think we're kind of fooling ourselves, and I don't think this is setting out to be like those books.

I want to understand better the function of this style, what it does, what it refuses; because it seems to me that it may be some kind of rebuke of something, but I'm not entirely sure what.<br/>Other than that, this is clearly a brilliant work. It defies genre in basically every way, and more importantly, it (that is, Fanon himself) is conscious of that fact. It is kind of haunting in a lot of ways, and reading it makes clear its personal nature - i.e. that this is not just a political treatise, but a kind of autobiography in many ways as well.

    "review": "The topic itself is, of course, not anything that could possibly be quantified on a 5 star spectrum, so there's no use in using that as a metric for this rating. I rate it 5 stars because the craft is thorough and excellent, and even if this is clearly a book written by a Westerner about Africa (the Africa that many Westerners like to imagine as some kind of primordial chaos), it is one of the good ones. <br/><br/>I think there are a few issues with Gourevitch's storytelling here, the most notable of which is the end where he essentially argues that it would be better if everyone just abandoned their ethnic labels and died all together. I get the sentiment, but the conclusion is very strange. At times I felt that there were generalizations and the classic Euro-American tendency to group Africans into one mass, but honestly, I can understand that in this context. I particularly wished to know more about the experience of non-génocidaires in the refugee camps, but again, I know that that was in many cases simply impossible. You can't possibly collect the entire stories and thoughts of everyone who experienced the genocide. It would be unfair for me to expect someone to be able to do all of that. There's one awkward moment where he wonders why there hasn't been a genocide in Bangladesh - another densely populated poor nation - but that's only really a notable issue for someone like me. <br/><br/>Other than that, however, this is a stunning book. (It would be hard, obviously, to write a book that isn't stunning about the Rwandan Genocide. But that's another story). There is a very real sense in which there are just no good options, no good answers, no good solutions - largely because of the mere scale of it all. How do you prosecute hundreds of thousands of people? How do you help hundreds of thousands - millions, even - who have lost everything in the most horrific possible way? And that's not even to mention the circumstances Rwanda was in after 1994 - unbelievable trauma, massive population loss followed by an equally massive gain, a world war, a \"developed\" world with little to no concern for those outside of its profit spheres, and you can go on forever. There is truly no good way forward, and I think that's the point. Kagame emerges looking like the exact man for the job, but the truth is there's no one that could've done this perfectly. <br/><br/>I suppose what I mean to say is that I can't really say much. Like, I could describe it as a tragedy, or an atrocity, or a catastrophe, or even apocalyptic, but none of that is really <i>enough</i>. How can you possibly describe the experience of someone who has watched their children be hacked to death? Ah.",

I didn't find him particularly complex, only strange in the way that I think most people are strange - aside from, of course, his being a murderer.
